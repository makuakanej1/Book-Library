Book Library Project:

Things I got to put into practice:

- I learned about objects and object constructors which was used to create new books to be added into the library
- Got good practice at manipulating the DOM and grabbing different elements of the DOM to be used in JS
- created multiple functions that had different responsibilities:
    - function to take in arguments to be used for the creation of a new book and pushing it into the library array
    - function to display the books to the DOM by selecting elements, creating elements, using the forEach method to iterate over the array, and appending the results to the DOM
    - function to delete books already created by splicing the element that the index in the array
- used modal and dialogue boxes for the first time to display form data to take in input data for new books
- learned and practiced more appending elements created and manipulated in JS to the DOM
